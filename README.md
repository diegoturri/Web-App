# Web-App

The application uses theMealDB API to retrieve information about different recipes and allows users to discover them , save them as favourites, and review them. 

Technical details:
- The application was implemented using the local storage, not an external DB. This way the project can be tested without setting particular environments.
- The number of request has been optimized and new recipes are being requested only if they havenâ€™t been requested before. This is achieved by storing the history of the requests in the local storage
